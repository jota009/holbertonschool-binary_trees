Binary Trees Project
Resources

To enhance your understanding of binary trees, please read or watch the following resources:

    Binary Tree (note the first line: Not to be confused with B-tree.)
    Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
    Tree Traversal
    Binary Search Tree
    Data Structures: Binary Tree

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:
General

    What is a binary tree?
    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
    What are the depth, height, and size of a binary tree?
    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
    What is a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree?

Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line.
    A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
    Your code should adhere to the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
    You are not allowed to use global variables.
    No more than 5 functions per file.
    You are allowed to use the standard library.
    The provided main.c files are examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repository. We will use our own main.c files for compilation, which may differ from the examples shown.
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file named binary_trees.h.
    Don’t forget to push your header file.
    All your header files should be include guarded.
